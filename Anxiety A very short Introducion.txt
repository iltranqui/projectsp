Anxiety is one of the fundamental emotions, as central a part of what it means to be human as happiness, sadness, or anger.

Anxiety doesn’t ever go away. There’s not suddenly a sun-lit plateau where you’re never anxious about anything – it just takes different shapes and forms. Cit: Micheal Palin

At the other end of the scale, everyday anxiety is as natural – and beneficial – as any other emotion. 

Wouldn’t life be much more pleasant if we weren’t susceptible to fear, or sadness, or disgust? In fact, without them, our lives would almost certainly be a great deal shorter. 
Emotions help us survive, thrive, and pass on our genes. As Paul Ekman, a leading psychologist of emotions, puts it, they have ‘evolved through their adaptive value in dealing with fundamental life-tasks’. 
So, for example, the happiness our ancestors felt after developing a useful tool encouraged them to repeat the experience; their sadness when separated from friends and loved ones helped them preserve crucial social ties;
and their anxiety helped ensure they didn’t end up as some wild animal’s meal.

An emotion lasts anywhere from seconds to hours. If it goes on for longer, it’s referred to as mood ; and if we have a tendency to react in this way, it’s part of our personality . 

Darwin sees emotions as primarily expressive behaviours: automatic, unconscious, and largely innate (rather than learned) physiological changes, facial expressions, and behaviours.

Stress is defined as what we feel when we believe we can’t cope with the demands facing us. It comprises two elements: a problem and a self-perception (specifically, that we’re not able to deal with the problem in question).
